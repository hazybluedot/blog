What is it with me an never quite being satisfied with how my personal website and/or blog is deployed? 
On this latest revison of my online presence I am moving back to a static-site generator (this time Hugo), paired with a headless CMS (currently Netlify). It took a bit of work to figure out that I could use Netlify for the headless CMS and still host the static files myself.
